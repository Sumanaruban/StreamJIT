StreamJIT
=========

StreamJIT is an embedded domain-specific language and commensal compiler
for synchronous dataflow stream programming, strongly inspired by
StreamIt.

For more details on StreamJIT and commensal compilation, see [StreamJIT: A
Commensal Compiler for High-Performance Stream Programming](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/papers/2014/bosboom-oopsla14-commensal.pdf),
published in OOPSLA 2014.
