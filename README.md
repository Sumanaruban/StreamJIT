Distributed StreamJIT
=====================

StreamJIT distributed compiler and runtime system for high-performance
synchronous dataflow stream programming, strongly inspired by StreamIt.


For more details on distributed StreamJIT and its advanced features such as
**cluster-wide dynamic recompilation, downtime free live reconfiguration, online program autotuning**,
